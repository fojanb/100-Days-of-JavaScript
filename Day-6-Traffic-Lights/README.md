### :heavy_check_mark: What you should see.
-  Blinking traffic light.
### :heavy_check_mark: JavaScript Used
- Comprehend setInterval() and setTimeOut() behaviour
- setInterval() : 
    The setInterval() method, offered on the Window and Worker interfaces, repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.
- setTimeOut() : 
    The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or 
    specified piece of code once the timer expires. In other wrods, it creates a delay in our code.
- Comprehend Asynchronous(non-blocking) vs Synchronous(blocking)
- Hint : Calling multiple setInterval() functions in js with a for loop?:
** setInterval has a delay which means when the interval runs the loop is already been finish. For loop is blocking and setInterval is non-blocking.
